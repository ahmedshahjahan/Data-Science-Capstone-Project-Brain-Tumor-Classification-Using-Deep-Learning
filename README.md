# BRAIN TUMOR CLASSIFICATION AND PREDICTION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
## Introduction:

A brain tumor is a collection, or mass of abnormal cells in our brain. Our skull, which encloses our brain, is very rigid. Any growth inside such a restricted space can cause problems. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). When benign or malignant tumors grow, they can cause the pressure inside our skull to increase. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threatening. Early detection and classification of brain tumors is an important research domain in the field of medical imaging and accordingly helps in selecting the most convenient treatment method to save patients life.

## Problem Identification

### Problem statement formation
Brain Tumor Classification and Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks to help automate the diagnostic process which will ensure proper treatment and will save lives and resources. 

### Context
Brain Tumors are complex. There are a lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s). This makes it difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor. Also, a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis. Often, in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRIâ€™. So, an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem.
