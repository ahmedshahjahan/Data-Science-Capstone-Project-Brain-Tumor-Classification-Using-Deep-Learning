# BRAIN TUMOR CLASSIFICATION AND PREDICTION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
## Introduction:

A brain tumor is a collection, or mass of abnormal cells in our brain. Our skull, which encloses our brain, is very rigid. Any growth inside such a restricted space can cause problems. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). When benign or malignant tumors grow, they can cause the pressure inside our skull to increase. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threatening. Early detection and classification of brain tumors is an important research domain in the field of medical imaging and accordingly helps in selecting the most convenient treatment method to save patients life.
